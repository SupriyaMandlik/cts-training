<h1>Paragraph writing</h1>
<h2>An apple a day keeps the doctor away</h2>
<p>an apple a day keeps the doctor away" aphorism was coined in 1913 but was based on the original 
	form with a different rhyme, some 149 years ago in Wales: "Eat an apple on going to bed and you'll
	keep the doctor from earning his bread," went the proverb in Pembrokeshire.</p>
